        <h2>1. how to lose urself at life</h2>
        <p>Despair is a hole. A real hole from which it is difficult to get out on your own if you landed there. The situation is aggravated by what has been happening around for more than a year. We are told that uncertainty is the new normal. However, it is not easy for a person to recognize and accept uncertainty. Rather, it is an additional burden that increases our susceptibility to emotional suffering. We begin to experience feelings of anxiety, despair, guilt, shame, resentment. Such emotions destroy us and deprive us of well-being and happiness.</p>
        
        <h2>If you are under constant emotional stress. What to do?</h2>
        <p>It's time to turn to your way of thinking. Finding answers is easy if you follow what you think, what emotions you experience. Do you feel anxious or humiliated, guilty or hurt? Do you have recurring negative thoughts? How do you mentally talk to yourself? If you scold yourself and are afraid to make a mistake, then you are not just “thinking” about yourself. This directly affects everything in your life - your decision-making mood and your actions. Thinking about some past discouraging experience or worrying that something bad will happen in the future are two of the most common types of repetitive thoughts. We get stuck thinking about past bad experiences, choices that led to today's consequences, and undesirable outcomes. We scold ourselves that we left our last job, which in fact turned out to be not so bad as it seemed to us. What they said to a friend what we think, but he was offended. That we missed the chance ... And we think a lot of other things. Anger, resentment, and other negative emotions feed our thoughts and we get stuck in them even more. And this type of thinking turns us into irritable, gloomy, envious and bitter personalities.</p>
        <ul>
            <p>Thoughts are the basis of dealing with stress. They form our emotions, and those, in turn, are reflected in the body. Thoughts are something that a person can and should influence. How to do it:</p>
            <li>stop and say to yourself: "Stop",</li>
            <li>convert from negative to positive</li>
            <li>track within yourself and direct in a positive direction or action.</li>
            <!-- Add more reasons here -->
        </ul>

        <h2>Thank You!</h2>
        <p>You can write down thoughts (keep a diary) or share experiences with others. Recently, I have come across the fact that sometimes the only person who is ready to listen, support, discuss feelings is not a close friend or relative, but a psychologist. It is especially sad if a child or teenager needs sympathy, experiencing deep loneliness from the inability to share problems with relatives, to be heard, to receive acceptance and respect for what he is experiencing at the moment of his life.</p>
